## Requirements

Use `python > 3.6` and install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requiurements.txt
```

## Running

The upcoming release of the code will include an API to allow the vignettes to be run on the models used in the [1]. In the interim, the --reproduce flag runs the code on precompied results to produce the results presented in [1]. Running run.py without --reproduce will run the inference engine on the models included in the repo, which are random noisy-OR networks. To run your own models, replace these and run the create_marginals method. 

**Please note that any information not used to generate the results in [1] is not included in the clinical vignettes. This includes doctor and patient information, and specifics such as disease and symptom concepts (other than the rareness of a disease)**

To reproduce the results from the paper:

```
python run.py --results my_results_dir --reproduce
```

To run on your own models, replace data/test_networks with your own network dictionary.

```
python run.py --first 10 
```
